# World Cup Database
This project is based on the 2018 FIFA World Cup teams. There are 32 competing nations in the tournament, divided into 8 groups, A through H, with each group having 4 countries. 

A CSV file for this project, worldcup.csv, contains 32 records, one for each country. Each record has 4 fields â€“ the name of the country, the group the country belongs to, goals scored, and points earned. This project will be read in the CSV file into an array of structure and implement functions that will search this array based on the country name, group, or points earned (user input).
